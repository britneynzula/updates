                <p style="font-size: 15px" class="card-text">To our esteemed graduands, students, lecturers and the entire Egoji Teachers’ College fraternity, I take this opportunity to welcome you all on behalf of the Board of Management to our 57th graduation ceremony. I wish to congratulate the graduands for having successfully completed their course and passing their exams. Today we recognize the results from your sacrifice, focus, commitment and hard work. <br>

                    <br>
                    I profoundly thank all the parents and guardians for the sacrifice you have made in giving your financial and emotional support to the graduands.

                    To the lecturers, we thank you for your tireless effort in preparing these graduands. We also acknowledge the role played by the non-teaching staff. I sincerely appreciate the concerted effort displayed by the college fraternity. <br>
                    <br>
                    I would like to recognize the effort and achievement of the Chief Principal. She is steering the college to greater heights of prosperity.

                    </p><hr>

                    In the year 2013 our college was the first Teacher Training College to attain ISO 9001:2008 certificate in the Republic of Kenya. I wish to proudly note that the college has now transited to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220105212005/https://egojittc.ac.ke/iso">ISO 9001:2015.
                    </a>. <br>
                    <br>
                    In line with the current trends of Education, we endeavour to train holistic teachers. This is evidenced by our achievement in the area of co-curricular activities where the college stand out in performance. Our graduands are of the high quality, good conduct and competent and as such very competitive. <br>
                    <br>
                    <i>Once again congratulations to all the graduands. You have done the college and your sponsor proud. </i>
                    <br> <b> May God bless you.</b><p></p>

                    I recognize that the good results that we are celebrating have been achieved through the integral role played by the office of the chief principal which coordinates the activities of many other stakeholders such as:

                    The graduation ceremony serves to remind the current students undergoing training that hard work pays. Each of them needs to invest in him/herself so that they can emulate their brothers and sisters graduating this year.
                    <br>
                    The office of the deputy principal is centered in the internal operations of the college in line with the college mission and vision. Some of the roles include: <br>

                    Approval of students long leave and chairing of the performance contracting committee <br>
                    My advice to the graduands is that they aspire to serve delight at every available opportunity and advance in education to be truly globally competitive.
