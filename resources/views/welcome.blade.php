                    <p class="lead">St. Lawrence Egoji Teachers' College, by its history and position finds itself with the inherent role of providing training
                        in the domain of Teacher Education in Kenya. As a country, we have experienced the impact of globalization and ICT
                        revolution among other emerging trends that has necessitated the government to reform the education and training sector
                        to respond to these emerging challenges. The college must therefore respond by identifying the opportunities and
                        avenues of creating new partnerships and collaborations, resulting in remarkable improvements in teacher education
                        nationwide and strengthening the quality of life. <br>
                        The tertiary education sub-sector in Kenya has experienced moderate growth over the last 40 years. However, it faces
                        challenges in producing adequate and skilled middle level human resource required to meet the demands for national
                        development. The college is therefore compelled to chart a new strategic direction guided by a shared vision, strategic
                        thinking and agility, - while at the same time being increasingly aware of the importance of its position in a national
                        context. It is against this backdrop that has necessitated the development of the 2017-2022 strategic plan upon which
                        the management of the college affairs will be based.
                        <br>
                        The College formulated its first five-year Strategic plan (2009 to 2014) which guided its operations from 2009 to 2013.
                        The strategic plan was reviewed in 2013, and culminated in the second Strategic Plan (2013-2017). The review arose
                        from the need to integrate and incorporate national development priorities in the College agenda as articulated in the
                        Kenya Vision 2030, the new constitution of Kenya 2010 and other government policies.
                        Through this strategic plan, the college intends to marshal its acknowledged strengths around identified opportunities in
                        order to address its weaknesses and minimize threats associated with its development, transformation and contribution to
                        the national agenda and the society in general.
                        <br>
                        The College developed a quality management system and was accredited with ISO 9001:2008 certification in 2013 by
                        the Kenya Bureau of Standards, and prides itself in being the first Teacher training college in Kenya to acquire this
                        prestigious certification. The motto of the College is ‘Lucere Ardere’ translated as: ‘burn to enlighten’.</p>
